          The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneath the towering
          smokestacks of four coal-fired power plants. A fifth plant has been
          proposed, the latest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets
          electricity.

        Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
        plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by
        uncertain economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of the
        plants to be abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        One such coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is already
        surrounded by four coal-fired power plants.
        <a href="https://www.amppartners.org/">American Municipal Power</a>
        has proposed building a new Meigs County coal plant, slated to begin
        construction late this year or in early 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following information provides background to explain why coal plants
        are at the center of a national debate over energy production and
        consumption.

          What’s the connection between coal and electricity?

          Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal. Coal-fired
          power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to turn the
          turbines of an electrical generator. <br />
          The U.S. has one of the largest coal reserves in the world and burns
          it at about 600 plants across the nation. Generating electricity from
          coal is common in the South and in the heartland, but less often used
          in regions such as the West Coast, where hydroelectricity and natural
          gas are bigger sources of power.

        <dt class="q">
          If coal is so important to electricity generation, why are some people
          concerned about building new coal-fired power plants?

          Coal plants emit carbon dioxide, a major ingredient in climate change.
          <br />In recent years, NASA climate scientist James Hansen has
          advocated a moratorium on building new coal plants until technology is
          developed to prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping into the
          atmosphere. <br />Hansen has warned that continuing to release carbon
          dioxide at current rates – even just for the next 10 years – will
          create “a different planet – one without sea ice in the Arctic; with
          worldwide, repeated coastal tragedies associated with storms and a
          continuously rising sea level.” <br />The proposed American Municipal
          Power plant in Meigs County would release an estimated 5.5 million
          tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to CARMA, a nonprofit
          group.

        <dt class="q">
          Why are there so many electricity-generating coal plants near Meigs
          County?
          <div class="accordion">

          Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s history.
          The county’s newest mine began producing coal last February.
          <br />An experimental site for carbon capture and sequestration, a
          technology to store carbon dioxide underground, is under construction
          in West Virginia near Meigs County's southern border. In addition, a
          coal-to-liquids facility and two other coal-fired power plants have
          been proposed for the region, although at least some of those plans
          appear to be on hold. <br />Meanwhile, Meigs County is one of the
          poorest counties in Ohio, according to 2000 U.S. Census data. Elisa
          Young, a Meigs County resident who has organized opposition to the new
          plant, argues that poverty reduces local opposition to the coal
          industry. <br />“When you have an economy that's entirely wrapped
          around coal, you can't speak out about it,” she says.
        </dd>

        <dt class="q">
          Some Meigs County residents are concerned about the health effects of
          coal plants. Why?
          <div class="accordion">
            <span></span>
            <span></span>
          </div>
        </dt>
        <dd class="a">
          In 2007, the four existing coal plants near Meigs County released
          millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, including arsenic, chromium,
          manganese, mercury, sulfuric acid aerosols and selenium, according to
          the Environmental Protection Agency.
          <br />Each of these chemicals has been linked to human health
          problems, such as cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, impaired motor
          skills and neurological damage. <br />Kent Carson, a spokesperson for
          American Municipal Power, said the proposed plant will use new
          technology to control pollutants. “This will be the cleanest facility
          of its type in the state,” he said.
        </dd>

        <dt class="q">
          Can it be proved that the coal plants are responsible for health
          problems in Meigs County?
          <div class="accordion">
            <span></span>
            <span></span>
          </div>

        <dd class="a">
          It can be hard to prove that any one of the chemicals caused health
          problems of a particular individual. <br />“We’re exposed to a soup of
          chemicals,” said Kevin Crist, director of the Center for Air Quality
          at Ohio University. Crist said health problems can be influenced by
          interactions between chemicals, as well as by lifestyle factors.
          <br />In addition, low income – a common characteristic in Meigs
          County – is correlated with health problems. One reason is that poor
          people are more likely to smoke than their wealthier counterparts.
          More than 30 percent of adult residents of Southeast Ohio smoke,
          compared to only about 25 percent of residents of other Ohio counties.
          <br />Crist said tall smokestacks on the existing plants probably
          disperse most pollutants away from Meigs County. But he said it is
          impossible to know for sure what residents are being exposed to,
          because no agency monitors the county’s air.

          So what do we know about air quality and health in Meigs County?

          An analysis by USA Today estimated that the air quality at Southern
          Elementary School in Meigs County is worse than the air quality at 97
          percent of the nation's schools. USA Today identified two of the coal
          plants near Meigs County as major contributors to pollution at the
          school. <br />In addition, men in Meigs County have the lowest life
          expectancy among men in any Ohio county, according to data compiled by
          Harvard University (women ranked 26th worst of 88 counties).
          <br />Meigs County also has the highest death rate of any Ohio county
          for lung and bronchus cancer, according to the Ohio Department of
          Health.
        </dd>

        <dt class="q">
          Despite the suspected health effects, wouldn’t a new plant create
          much-needed jobs?

          Blue-collar labor is especially important in Meigs County, where fewer
          than 5 percent of adult residents hold college degrees and more than
          25 percent have no high school diploma, according to the Ohio Office
          of Policy, Research and Strategic Planning. In 2007, Meigs County's
          median income was $27,287, about half the national average. <br />Many
          Meigs County residents support the new plant for the jobs it may bring
          to the community. Construction worker Greg Sheets has testified in
          favor of the plant at public hearings. <br />“My family will benefit
          by me going up there and working,” he said. “If I reached in your
          pocket and took $200,000 out of your pocket, would you like it?” he
          said, referring to the income he estimated he could earn during the
          four years it would take to build the plant. <br />But no one can
          guarantee how many jobs will actually go to Meigs County residents or
          how much they will pay. <br />“We all know that not all the workers
          are going to come from Meigs County,” said Sheets, the construction
          worker. “They’ll be from all over the country.”

          Before construction can begin on a new coal plant, an energy company
          must receive pollution permits from a state regulatory authority.
          <br />Carson, the American Municipal Power spokesman, said his utility
          has received all the permits it needs and that construction on the
          plant will start in late 2009 or early 2010. <br />Opponents of the
          plant have appealed the plant’s permits. The state of Ohio will allow
          construction to proceed during the appeals process.
